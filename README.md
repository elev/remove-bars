Chrome extension to remove annoying sharebars

TODO:
Sift through websites and create a more thorough list of the annoying elements.
Maybe create a way for other users to add them on the fly, store them on a remote server, and ping that server w/ajax.

Using pure javascript here not jquery, to keep things light and quick.


Anyone can clone this and do whatever they want... If certain elements always pop up, add them to the list, 
you could even getElementByTagName("*"); to get all the page elements, then target whatever id's you want.
It should be pretty flexible. 

INSTALL:
clone the repo,
open up chrome,
in the nav bar type "chrome://extensions/",
click "developer mode" checkbox,
click load unpacked extension,
and load this.
